<p>You might have noticed I have a website now. In fact, you're reading these very words on this website.
But why? Why do I need a website?
I've become gradually aware of a few things, the first of which is that I am in fact graduating from college. And starting a job.
And moving to an undetermined location to begin the next phase of my life. Maybe adopting a pet? Lots of change but one thing is certain - I'll continue to make stuff and to learn how to make stuff. People will keep asking me where they can see my work. And it would be nice to have
a little place I can point people to instead of rambling incoherently about my current fixation. But really, building this gives me the sense that the future is a place I'm prepared for. This is my little house on the internet and it is built with Rust and CSS.</p>
