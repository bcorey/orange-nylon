Hi, my name is Benjamin! I'm a Unity-certified developer who most recently interned with Onshape at PTC, coding CAD modeling tools for the web. I'm currently finishing one last metaphorical bowl of computer science + art & design soup at James Madison University.

This site is currently under construction but thanks for stopping by!
